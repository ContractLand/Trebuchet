# Load Test Framework

There are currently many supporting load testing for REST APIs but there are currently none that are extremely extendable to load test services that are not running REST protocols. This framework serve to change that. Originally intended to be used for load testing private Ethereum networks, this framework can be extended to load test or benchmark any other types of services.
